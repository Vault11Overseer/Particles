        ## DEMONSTRATION
            Follow this link to see my project   

    ### DESCRIPTION
        ## STACK
            * HTML
            * JavaScript
        ## SHORT DESCRIPTION
            This is a simple program that randomly paints mutli-color particles, based on your mouse position, to your screen.
        ## LONG DESCRIPTION
            This was a fun project using JavaScript to paint on an HTML canvas which is basically your screen.
            Particles spread and fill is based on whether you click or tap on your mouse pad.
        ## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
            In the future I plan on adding some slider settings to change the particles size, shape, color, etc.

    ### DEPLOYMENT
        ## REQUIRMENTS
            OS: ANY
            Languages: NONE

        ## Startup Install
            To use the finished project simple clone the files, add them to a server, then access the index.html.
        ## Dev Install 
            This is basically the same process. 
            Seeing as this is Vanilla JavaScript and HTML there are no dependencies or libraries to install.
