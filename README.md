    Particles

    ### STATUS
        ## CURRENT STATUS
            Live
        ## DEMONSTRATION
            Follow this link to see my project https://alteredartco.com/particles/

    ### DESCRIPTION
        ## STACK
            * HTML
            * JavaScript
        ## SHORT DESCRIPTION
            This is a simple program that randomly paints multi-color particles, based on your mouse position, to your screen.
        ## LONG DESCRIPTION
            This was a fun project using JavaScript to paint on an HTML canvas, which is basically your screen.
            Particles spread and fill are based on whether you click or tap on your mouse pad.
        ## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
            In the future, I plan on adding some slider settings to change the particles size, shape, color, etc.

    ### DEPLOYMENT
        ## REQUIRMENTS
            OS: ANY
            Languages: NONE
            Libraries: NONE
        ## Startup Install
            To use the finished project, simply clone the files, add them to a server, and then access the index.html.
        ## Dev Install 
            This is basically the same process. 
            Seeing as this is Vanilla JavaScript and HTML, there are no dependencies or libraries to install.
